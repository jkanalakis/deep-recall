Vector Embedding Management: Generates and manages embeddings in real-time using state-of-the-art embedding models such as SentenceTransformers, Hugging Face Transformers, and OpenAI-compatible models.


Vector Database Integration: Utilizes high-performance vector databases (FAISS, Qdrant, Milvus, Chroma) to efficiently store embeddings, supporting scalable indexing and querying.


Semantic Search: Implements efficient top-k retrieval using cosine similarity or other vector distance metrics. Configurable parameters include adjustable similarity thresholds, result pagination, and caching mechanisms for frequent queries.


Index Management: Periodic optimization of indices to maintain high performance. Implements incremental indexing and efficient data ingestion pipelines.


Backup and Recovery: Scheduled automated backups and recovery mechanisms ensuring data integrity, with version control and snapshot capabilities for audit and rollback purposes.


Inference Service
Model Hosting: Hosts open-source LLMs such as DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA models, leveraging PyTorch for efficient GPU-accelerated inference.


GPU Optimization: Supports CUDA-enabled GPU inference utilizing techniques like mixed-precision (FP16), dynamic batching, and model parallelism for optimal performance.


Model Deployment: Containerized deployment using Docker, optimized for rapid scaling in Kubernetes clusters with GPU nodes.


API Integration: Provides robust RESTful and/or gRPC API endpoints for handling inference requests and generating structured JSON responses, including detailed error handling and logging.


Scalability and Availability: Employs Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on GPU utilization, inference latency, and request queue metrics for automatic scaling. Ensures high availability and failover capabilities.


Health Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of model performance, GPU utilization, latency, and health status using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loguru with alerting mechanisms for quick incident response.


Orchestrator/API Gateway
Request Routing: Efficiently manages and routes incoming user requests to appropriate memory retrieval and inference services. Implements load balancing and traffic management strategies.


Context Aggregation: Aggregates context data retrieved from the Memory Service to create comprehensive, contextually enriched prompts for LLM inference.


Response Handling: Manages and consolidates responses from inference services, ensuring correct sequencing, response formatting, and timely delivery to end-users.


API Management: Exposes well-documented, standardized RESTful and/or gRPC APIs adhering to OpenAPI specifications for easy integration with external applications and front-end systems.


Security Enforcement: Implements authentication (OAuth/JWT) and authorization mechanisms to secure access to API endpoints. Manages encryption for data in transit.


Logging and Monitoring: Captures detailed logs of all incoming and outgoing traffic, errors, and system performance metrics. Integrates monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry for observability.


Data Flow:
User Request: User submits a request through an external interface (web or mobile application).


API Gateway: The gateway validates, authenticates, and authorizes the incoming request, performs initial parsing and routing based on request metadata.


Memory Retrieval: Gateway forwards the request to the Memory Service, which retrieves relevant past interactions by executing semantic similarity searches in the vector database to find the most contextually related conversation embeddings.


Context Aggregation: Relevant retrieved historical interactions and metadata are aggregated into a cohesive context payload, optimized and formatted appropriately for model input, respecting token limitations.


LLM Inference: Aggregated context and user query are submitted to the Inference Service, where the selected LLM processes the input through GPU-accelerated inference to generate a personalized, context-aware response.


Response: Generated responses from the LLM are returned to the Orchestrator, which formats and structures the final response payload, including metadata such as confidence scores and token usage.


User: The structured response is returned to the end-user via the original interface, completing the interaction cycle.

def summarize_text(text, max_length=150, min_length=40):
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=max_length, min_length=min_length, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']

Sep 3 - Integrate Context Management Logic:

def prepare_context_for_llm(conversation_history, token_limit=1024):
    context_text = " ".join(conversation_history)
